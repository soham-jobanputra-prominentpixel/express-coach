# Express Coach
---

A startup template for express that uses deno locally and node on production.

With this setup Deno is visible only on local vs-code setup and not a single trace on remote repo or production server! 

*Note:* delete `.gitignore` and rename `app.gitignore` to `.gitignore`.

`npm install`
`npm run dev`  OR `deno run dev`
